<h1>Welcome to my software Engineering portfolio !</h1>

<p>Hi my name is Amal and welcome to my portfolio site! I continuously improve myself by learning, designing and building things! </p>
<p>Currently I am learning Python with General Assembly and also learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have a passion for Electronic circuit building, Linux, computers, Finance and writing.</p>
<p>I believe best way to learn anything is by doing, so all the projects hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/1Amal?tab=repositories">GitHub Portfolio</a> are projects that I have used to learn different programming concepts.</p> 
<p>Good example is rather than using WordPress to develop and present my portfolio site, I decided to host this Portfolio website on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>This will enable me to develop my Front End development skills, keep my portfolio site up to date and keep me accountable for my self learning :-)</p>

<p>Enjoy exploring my portfolio !</p>
