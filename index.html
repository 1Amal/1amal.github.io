<h1>Welcome to my Software Engineering portfolio !</h1>

<div id="main_div">

<p>Hi, my name is Amal and I continuously improve myself by learning, designing and building stuff !<br>
Currently I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
I also have a passion for Electronic circuit building, Linux, Computers, Finance and Writing.<br>
I believe best way to learn anything is by doing, so all the projects hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/1Amal?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub Portfolio</a> are projects that I have used to learn different programming concepts.<br>
Good example is rather than using WordPress to develop this portfolio site, I decided to host this Portfolio website on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
This will enable me to develop my Front End development skills, keep my portfolio up to date and keep me accountable for my self learning :-)<br>

Enjoy exploring my portfolio !</p>

       <h2> <a href="https://amaldevelops.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">Weather App (click here for live version)</a></h2>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/1Amal/Python_Flask_Weather_App" target="_blank">Click here for Source Code</a></h3>
        
        Front end code for this WebApp is written in;
        <ul>
        <li>HTML, (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure this web page and its content</li>
        <li>CSS, (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of this document written in HTML</li>
        <li>Jinja, is a full-featured template engine for Python that is used to pass Python variables to the HTML web page</li>
            </ul>
        Back end code for this web app is written in;
    
        <ul>
        <li>Python, a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.</li>
        <li>Its design philosophy emphasises code readability with the use of significant indentation.</li>
        <li>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural),object-oriented and functional programming.<br> It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library</li>
        <li>Flask, is a lightweight WSGI web application framework</li>
        <li>OpenWeatherMap API, is used to receive Weather data</li>
        <li>Python Anywhere, is used to host this Webapp which allows you to host, run, and code Python in the cloud, which is pretty cool!</li>
