           All other elements must be descendants of this element.

<head> <!--Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element 
           The <head> HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.

    <!--
        Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag
        The browser's viewport is the area of the window in which web content can be seen. This is often not the same size as the rendered page, 
        in which case the browser provides scrollbars for the user to scroll around and access all the content.
        
        A typical mobile-optimized site contains something like the following:
        width: Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like width=600 or to the 
        special value device-width, which is 100vw, or 100% of the viewport width. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.
        
        height: Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like height=400 or to the special 
        value device-height, which is 100vh, or 100% of the viewport height. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

        initial-scale: Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 1. Negative values: ignored.

        minimum-scale: Controls how much zoom out is allowed on the page. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 0.1. Negative values: ignored.
        
        maximum-scale: Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page. Any value less than 3 fails accessibility. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. 
        Default: 10. Negative values: ignored.

        user-scalable: Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page. Valid values: 0, 1, yes, or no. Default: 1, 
        which is the same as yes. Setting the value to 0, which is the same as no, is against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./main.css"> <!-- Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element 
        The <link> HTML element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS, 
        but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.
        
        The <style> HTML element contains style information for a document, or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document 
        containing the <style> element.
    -->
    <title>Amal Kariyawasam, Software Engineering Portfolio</title> <!-- Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element 
        The <title> HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a Browser's title bar or a page's tab. 
        It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.

<body> <!-- Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element 
       The <body> HTML element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.

<h1>Amal's Software Engineering portfolio !</h1>
</div>

<div id="intro_div">

<p>Hi, my name is Amal and I continuously improve myself by learning, designing and building stuff !<br>
Currently I am learning JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Linux, software development best practices and core concepts 
by doing software projects and learning via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a><br>
I also have a passion for Electronic circuit building, Linux, Computers, Finance and Writing.<br>
This is because I believe best way to learn anything is by doing, so all the projects hosted on my 
<a href="https://github.com/1Amal?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub Portfolio</a> are projects that 
I have used to learn different programming concepts.<br>
A good demonstration is rather than using WordPress or a template to develop this portfolio site, I decided to host this Portfolio website 
on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can check the
<a href="https://github.com/1Amal/1amal.github.io" target="_blank">Code for this website by clicking here</a> <br>
This will enable me to develop my Front End development skills, learn GIT, Visual Studio Code, other software development 
tools while keeping my portfolio up to date.
As a strong believer in practically applying what I learn this will also keep me accountable for my self learning :-)<br>

<div id="portfolio">
    <h1>Project Highlights</h1>
    <p>Following are some of the highlights of my projects <a href="https://github.com/1Amal?tab=repositories" target="_blank">For full portfolio 
        please visit GitHub</a></p>
    
    <div id="weather-app">
       <h2>Weather App using Python/Flask, OpenWeatherMap API  
        <a href="https://amaldevelops.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank"> | Click here for the WebApp</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/1Amal/Python_Flask_Weather_App" target="_blank">| Click here for Source Code</a>
        </h2>
        
        Front end code for this WebApp is written in;
        <ul>
        <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used to structure the content and final result from OpenWeather API</li>
        <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):  Used to style the HTML webpage</li>
        <li>Jinja template engine:  Used to parse Python variables and the end result will render in HTML for presentation in a web browser</li>
            </ul>
        Back end code for this WebApp is written in;
    
        <ul>
        <li>Python: Used to make API calls to OpenWeather API and process the received JSON data</li>
        <li>Flask: Used as a lightweight WSGI web application framework</li>
        <li>OpenWeatherMap API: Used to pass location requests and receive Weather data in JSON format</li>
        <li>Python Anywhere: Used to host the WebApp </li>
            </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="engineering-reference">
        <h2>Software Engineering, Electronics, Telecommunications, Internet Engineering reference database 
            <a href="https://github.com/1Amal/engineering-reference" target="_blank">| Click here to visit</a></h2>
        
        <p>For software developers it is vital to keep a handy reference source which is available quickly, efficiently and from any location.</br>
           Before this reference repository was finally hosted on GitHub several methods were used to achieve this goal as follows.
           <ul>
                <li>First iteration was to put reference manuals and important information I found online into a Microsoft Word document and was saved in a folder in the local PC. 
                    Problem with this method was it was only available when working on the PC. 
                </li>
                <li> To solve this problem they were all uploaded to my Google Drive. Problem with this was updating the reference manuals and data was very cumbersome.</li>
                <li>Hence it was decided to collate all the information and to upload to GitHub so it can be accessed from anywhere, can be easily accessed, can be updated quite easily and anyone who needs this data is freely available for access. </li>
           </ul>
