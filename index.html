<h1>Amal's Software Engineering Portfolio !</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Amal and I continuously improve myself by learning, designing and building stuff !
Currently I am learning Front End Web Development via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank">The Odin Project.</a>
and use the concepts I learn to solve real life problems. I also have a passion for Electronic circuit building, Linux, Computers, Finance and Writing.
I believe best way to learn any subject or topic is by doing, so all the projects hosted on 
my <a href="https://github.com/1Amal?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub Portfolio</a> are projects that 
I have used to learn different programming concepts.

</p>

<div class="project-intro">
    <h1>Project Highlights</h1>
    <p>Following are some of the highlights of my projects <a href="https://github.com/1Amal?tab=repositories" target="_blank">For full portfolio 
        please visit GitHub</a></p>

        <p> When looking for the best way to present this Engineering portfolio several different platforms such as WordPress, VentraIP Australia custom Hosting, using templates
            etc.. was considered. Best technical and most efficient solution was to develop code on Visual Studio code on a Linux virtual machine,
            use Git to track version control, push to Github and use <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> to present the final portfolio.  
            Main advantage of this solution is that it enables me to develop my Front End development skills, learn software development
            tools and industry best practices while enabling me to showcase my projects. 
            Futhermore as a strong believer in practically applying what I learn this will also keep me accountable for my self learning :-)<br>

        <p>For software developers it is vital to keep a handy reference source which is available quickly, efficiently and from any location.</br>
           Before this reference repository was finally hosted on GitHub several methods were used to achieve this goal as follows.
           <ul>
                <li>First iteration was to put reference manuals and important information I found online into a Microsoft Word document and was saved in a folder in the local PC. 
                    Problem with this method was it was only available when working on the PC. 
                </li>
                <li> To solve this problem they were all uploaded to my Google Drive. Problem with this was accessing and searching the reference manuals and data was very cumbersome.</li>
                <li>Hence it was decided to collate all the information and to upload to GitHub so it can be accessed from anywhere, can be easily accessed, can be updated quite easily 
                    and anyone who needs this data is freely available for access. </li>
           </ul>
