        Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag
        The browser's viewport is the area of the window in which web content can be seen. This is often not the same size as the rendered page, 
        in which case the browser provides scrollbars for the user to scroll around and access all the content.
        
        A typical mobile-optimized site contains something like the following:
        width: Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like width=600 or to the 
        special value device-width, which is 100vw, or 100% of the viewport width. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.
        
        height: Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like height=400 or to the special 
        value device-height, which is 100vh, or 100% of the viewport height. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

        initial-scale: Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 1. Negative values: ignored.

        minimum-scale: Controls how much zoom out is allowed on the page. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 0.1. Negative values: ignored.
        
        maximum-scale: Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page. Any value less than 3 fails accessibility. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. 
        Default: 10. Negative values: ignored.

        user-scalable: Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page. Valid values: 0, 1, yes, or no. Default: 1, which is the same as yes. Setting the value to 0, which is the same as no, is against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

<div id="main_div">

<p>Hi, my name is Amal and I continuously improve myself by learning, designing and building stuff !<br>
Currently I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript by doing software projects and learning via <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a><br>
I also have a passion for Electronic circuit building, Linux, Computers, Finance and Writing.<br>
I believe best way to learn anything is by doing, so all the projects hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/1Amal?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub Portfolio</a> are projects that I have used to learn different programming concepts.<br>
Good example is rather than using WordPress to develop this portfolio site, I decided to host this Portfolio website on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
This will enable me to develop my Front End development skills, learn GIT, Visual Studio Code, other software development tools while keeping my portfolio up to date.
As a strong believer in practically applying what I learn this will also keep me accountable for my self learning :-)<br>

Enjoy exploring my portfolio !</p>

<div id="portfolio">
    <h1>Portfolio Highlights</h1>
    <p>Following are some of the highlights of my portfolio <a href="https://github.com/1Amal?tab=repositories" target="_blank">For full portfolio please visit my GitHub</a></p>

       <h2> <a href="https://amaldevelops.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">Weather App (click here for live version)</a></h2>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/1Amal/Python_Flask_Weather_App" target="_blank">Click here for Source Code</a></h3>
        
        Front end code for this WebApp is written in;
        <ul>
        <li>HTML, (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure this web page and its content</li>
        <li>CSS, (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of this document written in HTML</li>
        <li>Jinja, is a full-featured template engine for Python that is used to pass Python variables to the HTML web page</li>
            </ul>
        Back end code for this web app is written in;
    
        <ul>
        <li>Python, a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.</li>
        <li>Its design philosophy emphasises code readability with the use of significant indentation.</li>
        <li>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural),object-oriented and functional programming.<br> It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library</li>
        <li>Flask, is a lightweight WSGI web application framework</li>
        <li>OpenWeatherMap API, is used to receive Weather data</li>
        <li>Python Anywhere, is used to host this Webapp which allows you to host, run, and code Python in the cloud, which is pretty cool!</li>
