# Full Project List

## Strategy

- It is recommended GitHub projects should be accessed via an index such as from a website/LinkedIn projects section rather than from GitHub it self. Keeping this in mind we can name the repos as per the Repository naming conventions section.
- If any naming changes occurs it needs to be reflected on the Portfolio website & LinkedIn projects section.

## Repository naming conventions

- 1Amal is the GitHub username, after thorough research this is the best available short name, if you change this all the URL's will change so best not to change it.
- GitHub repo Names should be lower case
- Connect spaces with using a hyphen "-" ,this is due to GitHub pages URL's been case sensitive and to keep the URL names shorter. By using a hyphen it make things easy to read. i.e."project-name"
- DO NOT put the technology stack in the name as this makes the name longer and as well as the URL/Folder longer and confuses the user. Put the tech stack in the README.md and project info section which will show as a short description on github. Another good reason not to put the tech stack in the name is due to projects using different stacks for front-end and back-end which means if you use the tech stacks in the name it will be too long and cluttered.
