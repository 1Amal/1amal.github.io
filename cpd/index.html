        <h1>Amal's Online Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Tracker</h1>
<p>Hi I am Amal and welcome to my online CPD tracker page which I use to keep track of my progress as a Software Developer. In my journey to become a well rounded software developer I have tried many different methods of learning software development, i.e. Watching tutorials on Youtube, following online courses on platforms such as Udemy, reading tutorials, searching on Google and by doing software projects that I like.
One thing I realized quickly is that if I don't apply what I learn, I tend not to understand the concepts and learning does not stick. 
I love solving real world problems and when I encounter a problem I tend to break it down into small components and then try to find the optimal method to solve the problem most efficiently as every problem can be solved in so many different ways. 
I think the passion I have for Software development comes from my natural tendency to understand how the World works which has allowed me to have wide variety of interests ;
<ul>
    <li>Electronics Engineering: Which led me to get my degree in Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics Telecommunications and Internet Engineering.</li>
    <li>CyberSecurity: With the constant threat of Cyber incidents happening in the world and how much it is related to the widespread usage of technology in peoples lives led me to finish a "Graduate Certificate in CyberSecurity and Networking".</li>
    <li>Computers, Linux, Android phones and Microsoft Windows Technologies: Since at a young age I greatly enjoyed tinkering around with computers which led me to build few desktop computers, diagnose and trouble shoot Windows problems, learn Linux and also have an interest in Android Phones.</li>
    <li>Financial Markets: Which led me to study my "Diploma in Financial Planning" and to work as a Paraplanner in Financial planning in Melbourne CBD. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I wish to continue my journey of learning and developing as a Software developer till the day I have my last breath on this Earth.    </p>
